                The Provident Fund (PF) is a social security program initiated
                by the government to provide financial security to employees
                during their retirement. PF registration is the process by which
                employers enroll their employees in a provident fund scheme,
                ensuring both the employer and employee contribute a specific
                percentage of the employee's salary to the fund.{" "}

            <p>
              ESI registration is a mandatory process in India under the
              Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948. It provides social security
              and health insurance to employees, ensuring their well-being in
              various contingencies.
            </p>

            <p>
              ESI is a comprehensive social security and health insurance scheme
              designed to protect employees against financial distress and
              health issues arising from situations such as sickness, maternity,
              disablement, and employment injury.
