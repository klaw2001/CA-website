                Amending or updating private limited documents refers to the
                process of making changes to the foundational documents of a
                private limited company. These documents outline the company's
                structure, operations, rights, and responsibilities of its
                shareholders and directors. The primary documents that may need
                to be amended or updated include the Memorandum of Association
                (MOA) and the Articles of Association (AOA).
