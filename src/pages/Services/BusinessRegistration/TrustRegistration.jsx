                  <li>Asset Protection: Registered trusts may offer enhanced asset protection benefits by legally separating trust assets from the personal assets of the settlor and beneficiaries, thereby shielding them from creditors and legal claims.</li>
                  <li>Tax Planning Opportunities: Registered trusts may provide tax planning opportunities, such as minimizing estate taxes, capital gains taxes, and income taxes through strategic trust structures and distributions.</li>
                  <li>Creditor Protection: In some jurisdictions, registered trusts may offer additional creditor protection benefits, making it more difficult for creditors to access trust assets to satisfy debts or claims against the settlor or beneficiaries.</li>
                  <li>Estate Planning Flexibility: Registered trusts offer flexibility in estate planning, allowing settlors to designate beneficiaries, specify distribution terms, and preserve wealth for future generations in accordance with their wishes.</li>

                  <li>Loss of Privacy: Registered trusts may entail a loss of privacy, as certain information about the trust, its settlor, trustee(s), and beneficiaries may become a matter of public record, depending on the jurisdiction's registration requirements.</li>
                  <li>Regulatory Compliance: Registered trusts are subject to regulatory compliance requirements, such as filing annual returns, maintaining accurate records, and adhering to legal and tax obligations, which can be time-consuming and burdensome.</li>
