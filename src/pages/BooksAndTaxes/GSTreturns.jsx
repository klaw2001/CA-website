                    <li>
                      GSTR-2A is intended to assist businesses in reconciling
                      their purchases with the data available from their
                      suppliers. It helps ensure that you have accurate records
                      of your input tax credit (ITC) claims, which is essential
                      for complying with GST regulations.

                    <li>
                      While GSTR-2A provides auto-drafted information, it
                      doesn't serve as the return that you directly file.
                      Instead, it acts as a reference for you to verify the
                      details of your inward supplies. You can accept, reject,
                      or modify these auto-drafted details.

                  <strong>Due Dates for Filing GSTR-2A:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      GSTR-2A itself is not directly filed by taxpayers. It is
                      generated and made available for you to view on the GST
                      portal based on the information submitted by your
                      suppliers in their GSTR-1 returns.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The due dates for reconciling and acting upon the
                      information in GSTR-2A depend on your filing of the
                      GSTR-3B return, which is where you claim input tax credit
                      (ITC). Generally, GSTR-3B has a due date by the 20th of
                      the following month for most taxpayers, and ITC can be
                      claimed while filing GSTR-3B.

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      GSTR-2B is an auto-generated report prepared by the GSTN
                      (Goods and Services Tax Network) system for registered
                      taxpayers. It serves as an Input Tax Credit (ITC)
                      statement.

                    <li>
                      GSTR-2B compiles information about your potential ITC
                      based on the auto-drafted details of your inward supplies
                      of goods and services. The information is obtained from
                      the GSTR-1 and GSTR-5 returns filed by your suppliers.
                    </li>

                  <strong>Purpose of GSTR-2B:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The primary purpose of GSTR-2B is to provide taxpayers
                      with a summarized view of their eligible ITC. It helps
                      taxpayers review and understand the ITC available to them
                      for a particular tax period.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <strong>Role in the GST Return Filing Process:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      GSTR-2B is not the return that you directly file. Instead,
                      it is a reference document to help you ensure that you are
                      claiming ITC accurately. You should use it to cross-verify
                      the potential ITC available and reconcile it with your own
                      purchase records.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <strong>Due Dates for GSTR-2B:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      GSTR-2B is generally auto-generated based on the data
                      available from your suppliers' GSTR-1 and GSTR-5 returns.
                      It is typically available for viewing and download on the
                      GST portal. There are no specific due dates for GSTR-2B
                      because it is not a return that you file directly. It is
                      usually made available for viewing after your suppliers
                      have filed their respective returns. You can download and
                      use it as needed during the tax return filing process.

                    <li>
                      Tax liability was calculated by taking the total GST on
                      outward supplies and adjusting it with the available ITC.
                      The result was the net tax payable for that particular
                      month.

                      If a taxpayer failed to file GSTR-3 within the due date,
                      they might be liable for late fees and interest on the

                      GSTR-3 played a crucial role in reconciling the ITC
                      claimed by the taxpayer with the details furnished by
                      their suppliers in their GSTR-1 and GSTR-2 returns.

                    Input Tax Credit (ITC) is a mechanism under the Goods and

                    the tax they have paid on input purchases against the tax
                    they collect on sales. It ensures that taxes paid on inputs
                    are not a cost to the business, promoting the principle of
                    avoiding tax on tax.

                    <strong>Overview:</strong> Anti-profiteering provisions under GST are designed to ensure that businesses pass on the benefits of reduced tax rates and Input Tax Credit (ITC) to consumers.
