                    <p>
                      Professional Tax serves as a crucial source of revenue for
                      state governments. The funds collected through this tax
                      contribute to various development projects, infrastructure

                      The revenue generated from Professional Tax is often

                      in financing municipal services, maintaining public

                      Professional Tax is structured based on income slabs,
                      making it a progressive tax. Individuals with higher
                      incomes contribute more to the tax pool. This aligns with
                      the principles of a progressive taxation system, where
                      those who can afford to contribute more do so.

                      ensures a streamlined and efficient collection process.
                      Employers play a crucial role in facilitating compliance
                      and contributing to the revenue stream.

                      healthcare, and poverty alleviation initiatives. This

                      Tamil Nadu levies Professional Tax on individuals earning
                      income from a profession or trade. The tax rates are
                      structured based on income slabs. Employers are required
                      to deduct and deposit the tax on behalf of their
                      employees.

                    <h5>Gujarat:</h5>
                    <p>
                      In Gujarat, the Professional Tax rates are based on income
                      slabs. The tax is collected by employers from the salaries
                      of their employees and remitted to the state government.
                      Professionals are also required to register and pay
                      Professional Tax if they are self-employed.

                    <p>
                      Kerala imposes Professional Tax on individuals engaged in
                      various professions and trades. The tax rates are
                      determined based on income levels. Employers are
                      responsible for deducting and remitting the tax on behalf
                      of their employees.

                    <h5>Andhra Pradesh and Telangana:</h5>
                    <p>
                      These states follow the slab-based system for Professional
                      Tax. Employers play a crucial role in deducting and
                      depositing the tax on behalf of their employees.

                    <h5>Delhi:</h5>
                    <p>
                      Delhi does not impose a Professional Tax. Therefore,
                      individuals working in Delhi are not subject to this tax.
                      However, individuals residing or working in Delhi but
                      employed in a state that levies Professional Tax may be
                      required to pay it.
