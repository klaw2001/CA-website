              <h2>Objectives of Audit</h2>
              <p>In conducting an audit of financial statements, the objectives of the auditor, in accordance with SA-200 "Overall Objectives of the Independent Auditor and the Conduct of an Audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing," are:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Obtain Reasonable Assurance:</strong>
                  <p>The auditor aims to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements, as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. This enables the auditor to express an opinion on whether the financial statements are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with an applicable financial reporting framework.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Report and Communicate:</strong>
                  <p>The auditor must report on the financial statements and communicate as required by the SAs, in accordance with the auditor’s findings.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </Col>
          </Row>
          <Row>
            <Col>
              <h3>Key Points:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Reasonable assurance is sought, which is not absolute but a high level of assurance.</li>
                <li>Audit procedures are conducted with professional competence and skills in accordance with Standards on Auditing.</li>
                <li>Misstatements in financial statements can result from fraud, error, or both, and the auditor seeks to detect and assess their impact.</li>
                <li>Obtaining reasonable assurance enables the auditor to express an opinion on the financial statements' compliance with the applicable financial reporting framework.</li>
                <li>The opinion is communicated through a written report in accordance with audit findings and Standards on Auditing.</li>

              <h2>Benefits of Audit: Why Audit Is Needed?</h2>
              <p>Audited accounts provide high-quality information, instilling confidence in users that the information is reliable and meets global auditing standards.</p>
              <p>In the case of companies, shareholders rely on financial statements prepared by management. An independent audit safeguards shareholder interests by ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial information.</p>
              <p>Audit serves as a deterrent against employee fraud, as the fear of detection by auditors acts as a moral check.</p>
              <p>Government authorities use audited financial statements to determine tax liabilities accurately.</p>
              <p>Lenders and bankers rely on audited financial statements to make informed credit decisions, assessing the creditworthiness of entities.</p>
              <p>Audit helps detect fraud or errors, providing assurance on the integrity of financial reporting.</p>
              <p>Audit reviews the existence and effectiveness of controls within an entity, identifying deficiencies and areas for improvement.</p>
